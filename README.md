# n8n-Audio-Transcription-And-Summary-Creation
Provides transcription capabilities and summary creation through n8n and AssemblyAI when starting with a WordPress post or audio link. Approvals will be sent via gmail and the output will be a google doc.

# üîâ‚û°Ô∏èüìÑ AssemblyAI Audio to Text Transcription

The AssemblyAI Audio to Text Transcription n8n workflow uses AssemblyAI to transcribe an audio file when given the audio link. There is functionality to split the transcript into paragraphs so that it is easier for the user to read. This is one part of a larger workflow that me and my colleagues are designing, but it is possible to make it function by itself.

## üìÉ How It Works

This workflow can take inputs of either a WordPress Post or an audio link, both of which eventually ouput as a Google Doc, with the WP Post being updated if the input was a WP Post. To switch the input, deactivate the other form node and activate the desired node.

- WordPress post is the input since the audio link form is deactivated

- Audio link is the input since the WordPress post form is deactivated

When executing the workflow, a popup will appear.
- If the WordPress post form was activated, enter the **post ID** into the text box.
- If the audio link form was activated, enter the audio link into the text box.

If the input was a WP post, OpenAI will extract the information out of it, including the audio link within. Then, both inputs share the same path; turn the audio link into a file, uploading the file to AssemblyAI, transcribing the file, and outputting the transcription.

Next, a Google Doc will be created and populated with the transcript, and then will be sent off for approval. You may edit the transcript and then click approve, which will send the updated transcript to OpenAI to summarize it. The summary will then be added to the document and sent for a final approval.

- This is what an approval email would look like

Finally, the workflow will output the completed Google Doc, updating the WordPress post if there was one to begin with.

## üìù Important Notes

If the file size is too large, the workflow may error, disconnect from the server, timeout, or be infinitely "working" while doing nothing. I think this is due to memory limitations in n8n, and there is nothing that can be done about it except upgrading to a better n8n plan. Sometimes this happens, but sometimes it does not, it could depend on others using the n8n server at the same time. I don't have a great solution to this except to tell you to upload smaller files if this happens.
